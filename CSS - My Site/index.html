        <h3>Testing and Development</h3>
        <p>I was exposed to my first program when I was a kid back when floppy disks were still a thing and Organ trail was on Apple IIe.
        I've since loved it and find it to be very relaxing and de-stressing similar to crafting a beautiful portrait on a canvas
        I find web development to be the most fun though as I can limit my creativity only to what is in my mind.</p>

        <h3>Tea Master</h3>
        <p>There is nothing like a warm cup of Chamomile or Jasmine tea at the end of a busy day.
        It's healthy and you live longer, so be adventurous and try Gotu Kola.</p>
