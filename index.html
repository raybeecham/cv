        <p>
          I am currently a senior student at Texas State University pursuing a Bachelors of Business Administration with
          an emphasis in Computer Information Systems. I've been involved with many projects in class that have required
          me to come up with creative solutions that solve problems such as developing a website for project management
          emphasizing the principles of Scrum.</p>

    I've also been involved in leading and managing and held the position as shift lead at Grifols and am the sitting
    vice president of Corporate Relations in the Association for Information Technology Professionals and have
    previously held the position of Chapter Affairs.</p>

  <p>
    In class I am working with Java, Android Studio, Tableau, and R to understand the principles of data analytics,
    but outside of class I am working on Web Development and understanding full stack development.
  </p>
  <p>
    When asked my instructors, managers, classmates, and co-workers describe me as someone who is dedicated to my work
    and who is hardworking, creative, collaborative, passionate, and strategic.</p>
  <p>
    My top 5 Clifton strengths are:
    <p>1. <strong>Deliberative</strong></p>
    <p>2. <strong>Futuristic</strong></p>
    <p>3. <strong>Intellection</strong></p>
    <p>4. <strong>Competition</strong></p>
    <p>5. <strong>Ideation</strong></p>


    <p>
      I will be graduating August 2019 and plan to pursue a career in application development and/or project management.
      I am eager to pursue a position in which I can solve problems, change the world, and disrupt the existing technology. In the
      meantime, I will continue to acquire new skills and build a solid professional network.
      Please feel free to contact me if you would like to connect, or are aware of any potential opportunities for
      which you think I may be appropriate.</p>
